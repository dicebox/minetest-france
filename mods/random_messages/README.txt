This is a fork of RandomMessages mod by arsdragonfly.

What does it do? 

Same as the original mod, see below for chat command details
	* Display chat messages (hints, mod usage, etc.) from file : (world directory)/random_messages

+ Import messages from a default file located in mod directory
+ Support the use of localized suffix (e.g : messages.fr.txt)
+ Place signs around the world with messages on it
+ Cofiguration file (config.lua) to turn on/off the chat messages or the signs and other options  

Optional but recommanded mods : signs_lib (to use the yard sign)

Chat messages are disabled by default : edit config.lua to use chat messages
